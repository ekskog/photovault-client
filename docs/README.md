## Backend API

This frontend connects to the [HBVU PHOTOS API](https://github.com/ekskog/photovault-api) which provides:

- `GET /buckets` - List buckets
- `POST /buckets` - Create bucket
- `GET /buckets/:bucketName/objects` - List objects/folders
- `POST /buckets/:bucketName/upload` - Upload files
- `POST /buckets/:bucketName/folders` - Create folder
- `DELETE /buckets/:bucketName/folders` - Delete folder

API uses MinIO storage backend and returns JSON responses.
