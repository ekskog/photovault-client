HBVU PHOTOS Frontend - Kubernetes Deployment Resume
=====================================================

TASK OVERVIEW:
Deploy the HBVU PHOTOS Vue.js frontend application to a Kubernetes cluster using MetalLB (no ingress needed), with automated CI/CD pipeline via GitHub Actions.

COMPLETED OBJECTIVES:
✅ Docker Build Infrastructure - Successfully built Docker image with multi-stage build (Node.js + nginx)
✅ Docker Testing - Local container testing on port 8080 confirmed working
✅ GitHub Container Registry Setup - Updated CI/CD to use ghcr.io instead of Docker Hub
✅ Kubernetes Configuration - Created deployment and service manifests for photovault namespace
✅ Complete CI/CD Pipeline - GitHub Actions workflow that builds, pushes to registry, and deploys to k3s
✅ KUBECONFIG Secret Setup - Fixed GitHub secrets configuration for cluster access
✅ Deployment Success - Pipeline now successfully deploys to photovault namespace via MetalLB

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Docker Configuration:
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile with Node.js build stage and nginx runtime
   - Custom nginx.conf for Vue.js SPA routing
   - Image size optimization through staged builds

2. Container Registry:
   - Migrated from Docker Hub to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
   - Registry: ghcr.io/ekskog/photovault-frontend
   - Automated tagging with Git commit SHA and 'latest'

3. Kubernetes Resources:
   - Namespace: photovault
   - Deployment: photovault-frontend-deployment (3 replicas)
   - Service: photovault-frontend-service (LoadBalancer type)
   - MetalLB integration for external IP assignment

4. CI/CD Pipeline:
   - GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push to main branch
   - Build -> Test -> Push -> Deploy sequence
   - Kubernetes deployment using kubectl with KUBECONFIG secret
   - Automated rollout status verification

5. Infrastructure Files Created:
   - /Dockerfile - Multi-stage container build
   - /nginx.conf - Nginx configuration for Vue SPA
   - /k8s/deployment.yaml - Kubernetes deployment manifest
   - /k8s/service.yaml - LoadBalancer service manifest
   - /.github/workflows/deploy.yml - Complete CI/CD workflow
   - /deploy.sh - Manual deployment script
   - /CI-CD-SETUP.md - Setup documentation

KEY CHALLENGES RESOLVED:
- Fixed GitHub Container Registry authentication
- Corrected Kubernetes namespace configuration (default -> photovault)
- Resolved deployment workflow order (create before update)
- Configured proper KUBECONFIG secret encoding for GitHub Actions
- Implemented proper Vue.js SPA routing in nginx

DEPLOYMENT STATUS:
✅ COMPLETE - PhotoVault frontend successfully deployed to Kubernetes cluster
✅ LoadBalancer service active with MetalLB integration
✅ Automated CI/CD pipeline functional and tested
✅ Application accessible via assigned external IP

TECHNOLOGY STACK:
- Frontend: Vue 3 with Composition API, Vite build tool
- Container: Docker with nginx runtime
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (k3s)
- Load Balancing: MetalLB
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Registry: GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)

FINAL ARCHITECTURE:
GitHub Repository -> GitHub Actions -> GitHub Container Registry -> Kubernetes (photovault namespace) -> MetalLB LoadBalancer -> External Access

Date Completed: June 3, 2025
